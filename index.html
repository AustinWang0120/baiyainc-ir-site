							We, Baiya International Group Inc. (“Baiya”), are an offshore
							holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. We are not a
							Chinese operating company, but an offshore holding company
							incorporated in the Cayman Islands. As a holding company, we have
							no material operations and conduct all of our operations in China
							through the VIE, Shenzhen Gongwuyuan Network Technology Co., Ltd.
							(“Gongwuyuan”), and its subsidiaries, collectively, “PRC operating
							entities”. Gongwuyuan started to provide job matching services in
							2017. In November 2019, Gongwuyuan began developing its
							cloud-based internet platform to provide one-stop crowdsourcing
							recruitment and SaaS-enabled HR solutions on the Gongwuyuan
							Platform to supplement its offline job matching services, and
							started to position itself as a SasS-enabled HR technology company
							by introducing its Gongwuyuan Platform in the flexible employment
							marketplace. We have been and will continue to strategically
							develop and improve the Gongwuyuan Platform with product features
							that work together with our traditional offline service model to
							improve the job matching and HR related services in the flexible
							employment marketplace.

						Currently our business focuses on four (4) primary services: (i) job
						matching services; (ii) entrusted recruitment services; (iii)
						project outsourcing services; and (iv) labor dispatching services in
						the flexible employment market within China, primarily in the core
						manufacturing regions including the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze
						River Delta region. With respect to labor dispatching services,
						however, we are strategically reducing this service, considering the
						negative gross profit historically. Gongwuyuan plans to pursue its
						business growth by continuing to supplement its existing offline
						service model by introducing and integrating its Gongwuyuan Platform
						to provide better services in the flexible employment market
						throughout China. In addition, we plan to improve our services by
						continuing to develop and integrate digital technologies including
						crowdsourcing, big data and artificial intelligence to enhance the
						Gongwuyuan Platform. We believe these efforts will allow us to
						provide sufficient job matching and one-stop SaaS-enabled HR
						solutions to Customers, Employing Companies and workers in the
						flexible employment marketplace throughout China.
