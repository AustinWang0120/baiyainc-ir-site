				<h1 class="service__title">Job matching service</h1>
				<p class="service__description">
					Under job matching service model, the Company connects the Employing
					Companies and the HR Service Companies based on the quantity and the
					duration of the blue-collar labor the Employing Company plans to
					recruit. Once the contract between the Employing Companies and HR
					Service Companies were signed, the Company charges the service fee to
					the Employing Company by the quantity of labor recruited at the
					pre-determined rate per capita per month designated in the contract
					between the Company and the Employing Companies. The Company considers
					that the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefit in
					the service period designated by the contract term and therefore
					recognizes the revenue over time since blue-collar labor starts to
					work for the Employing Companies.

				<p class="service__description">
					Under entrusted recruitment service model, the Employing Companies and
					HR Service Companies are both confidential to each other, the
					Employing Companies select the labor candidates provided by us (and
					directly with the HR Service Companies, and HR Service Companies are
					not allowed to contact the Employing Companies). The Employing
					Companies directly submit recruitment requests to the Company for
					their recruitment needs, which typically include the number of
					blue-collar workers needed, work hours, the preferred and required
					skill sets, etc. (the “Overall Work Arrangement”). Once the overall
					work arrangement is established, the Company confirms the information
					regarding employment needs of the Employing Company. Subsequently, the
					Company negotiates with the labor service company to organize
					blue-collar workers. The labor service companies provide information
					of the workers and registers basic personal information of the workers
					for the Company. During the execution of the contract between the
					Company and the Employing Companies, the Company regularly
					communicates with the Employing Company to resolve issues and collect
					feedback on the performance of the blue-collar workers. The Company is
					responsible for briefing the workers for the Employing Companies’
					culture, rules and regulations, worker’s job responsibilities, code of
					conduct, and provides short term vocation training if needed. The
					Company considers that the customers simultaneously receive and
					consume the benefit in the service period designated by the contract
					term and the Company recognizes the revenue over time since such
					blue-collar labor started to work for the Employing Companies.

				<h1 class="service__title">Labor dispatching service</h1>
				<p class="service__description">
					Under labor dispatching service model, the Customers submit their
					labor needs and the Company dispatches its employees directly to the
					Customers. The Company is responsible for the payment of wages to the
					dispatched workers, and charges service fee to the Customers based
					upon the total number of working hours of the dispatched employees of
					the Company. The Company considers that the Customers simultaneously
					receive and consume the benefit as well as the dispatch services. The
					Company controls the specified service before that service is
					performed for a customer. Due to the negative gross profit of labor
					dispatching service, we determined not to expand this business line
					but strategically reduce the labor dispatching service. As of June 30,
					2023, Gongwuyuan has cooperated and partnered with 15 corporate
					clients, including 7 agency recruitment clients, 8 outsourcing
					business clients, in core manufacturing regions such as the Pearl
					River Delta and Yangtze River Delta regions. As of June 30, 2023,
					there are over 4,992 labor companies and 3,142 enterprises registered
					on the Gongwuyuan Platform. Gongwuyuan believes that it will be able
					to convert 10% of such potential customers in the future, which will
					increase the number of clients that it cooperates and partners with by
					over 700.
